            How important is fitness and exercise for your mental health?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Research shows that fitness and exercise improves mental health by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood and by improving self-esteem and cognitive function. Exercise has also been found to alleviate symptoms such as low self-esteem and social withdrawal. It can also improve your sleep, which is often disrupted by stress, depression and anxiety. Exercise is an important factor as it associates directly with how a person's mental health is affected. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Above is a table with relevant exercises that you can attempt when you feel your mood has slightly dampened because of something someone has said or maybe when you are not having the most easiest of times. The fitness activities can temporarily alleviate your mood and mental health overall.

        Yoga Exercises
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Directions
      </h3>
      <p>
        Perform each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds. You can perform each exercise in one single push or take mini breaks and then go back into the same movement.
      </p>
      <h4>
        1. Child's Pose
      </h4>
      <p>
        Get into a kneeling position with your knees hip-distance apart and feet together behind you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a deep inhale, and on the exhale lay your torso over your thighs, pressing your butt onto your heels and reaching your arms forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about lengthening your neck and spine by drawing your ribs away from your tailbone and the crown of your head away from your shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rest your forehead on the mat. You should feel a stretch on your backside and possibly in your hips. You may also feel a stretch in your arms if they are straight in front. Hold for 30 to 60 seconds.
      </p>
      <h5>
        If you feel any back pain in this position, bring your knees closer together.
      </h5>
      <div>
        <img src="childs pose.png" alt="Child's Pose" class="yoga">
      </div>
      <h4>
        2. Cat-Cow
      </h4>
      <p>
        Start on all fours with your shoulders over your wrists and hips over knees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a slow inhale, and on the exhale round your spine and drop your head toward the floor (this is the Cat posture).
      </p>
      <p>
        Inhale and lift your head, chest, and tailbone toward the ceiling as you arch your back for Cow.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s 1 rep. Continue performing reps for 30 to 60 seconds. You should feel a stretch in your spine and possibly your glutes and shoulders as well.
      </p>
      <h5>
        To round your spine even more in Cat position, press into the floor with your hands and knees.
      </h5>
      <img src="catcow.webp" alt="Cat-Cow Pose" class="yoga">
      <h4>
        3. Puppy Pose
      </h4>
      <p>
        Get into tabletop position with your wrists under shoulders, knees under hips.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walk your arms forward and bring your chin to the floor while keeping your butt lifted above your knees. Your arms should be stretched out in front and your armpits lifted off the floor. You should feel a stretch in your armpits, across the front of your chest, and in your core.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hold for 30 to 60 seconds.
      </p>
      <h5>
        If it hurts to rest your chin on the floor, rest your forehead instead.
      </h5>
      <img src="puppy.jpg" alt="Puppy Pose" class="yoga">
      <h4>
        4. Lunging Hip-Flexor Stretch
      </h4>
      <p>
        Kneel on one knee. Place the opposite foot flat in front of you, front thigh parallel to the floor, ankle underneath your knee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hold this position or, for a deeper stretch, lean forward, stretching your hip toward the floor (just make sure your knee doesn’t extend over your ankle).
      </p>
      <p>
        Squeeze your butt; this will allow you to stretch your hip flexor even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        For an even deeper stretch, reach up with the arm on the same side as the knee on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hold for 30 to 60 seconds. Switch sides and repeat.
      </p>
      <h5>
        This is a more intense stretch, so you may want to take breaks during the 30 to 60 seconds, instead of holding the stretch all the way through. Also, if your grounded knee hurts, put a towel or doubled-over yoga mat under it for extra cushion.
      </h5>
      <img src="hip.avif" alt="Lunging Hip-Flexor Stretch" class="yoga">
      <h4>
        5. Downward Facing Dog
      </h4>
      <p>
        Start on your hands and knees with your hands stacked under your shoulders and knees under your hips.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spread your hands wide and press your index finger and thumb into your mat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lift your tailbone and press your butt up and back, drawing your hips toward the ceiling. Straighten your legs as best as you can and press your heels gently toward the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your head should be relaxed between your arms, facing your knees; your shoulders should be pulled back and down; and your back should be flat. You may feel a stretch in your hamstrings, calves, back, and/or shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hold for 30 to 60 seconds.
      </p>
      <h5>
        To help relieve low back tension, bend your knees. Keeping straight knees will work hamstring and glute mobility.
      </h5>
      <img src="dog.webp" alt="Downward Facing Dog" class="yoga">
      <h4>
        6. Forward Fold
      </h4>
      <p>
        Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
      </p>
    <p>
        Straighten your legs out as much as you can without locking your knees and let your torso hang down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tuck your chin in toward your chest, relax your shoulders, and extend the crown of your head toward the floor to create a long spine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Depending on your flexibility, your hands will touch the floor or dangle above floor level. You can hold onto each elbow with the opposite arm or let your arms hang separately.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should feel a stretch in your back and hamstrings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hold for 30 to 60 seconds.
    </p>
    <h5>
        If you feel tension in your low back, bend your knees. For a deeper release of tension in the back and hamstrings, place a block underneath your hands and press into it.
    </h5>
    <img src="fold.webp" alt="Forward Fold" class="yoga">
    <h4>
        7. Seated Spinal Twist
    </h4>
    <p>
        Sit up straight on your butt with your legs crossed. Make sure you’re not rounding your pelvis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Place your left arm on your right knee and your right arm behind you, fingers on the ground facing away from your body.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Inhale and elongate your spine, then exhale and rotate to the right. Your goal is to look over your right shoulder while also keeping both shoulders relaxed and away from your ears.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hold for 30 to 60 seconds. Switch sides and repeat.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Take your time to ease into this stretch; don’t yank your spine.
    </h5>
    <img src="twist.webp" alt="Seated Spinal Twist" class="yoga">
    <h4>
        8. Pigeon Pose
    </h4>
    <p>
        From a kneeling position, get into Downward Facing Dog and extend your right leg high behind you. Then bring your right leg underneath your body and place it in front of you with your shin parallel to the top of your mat. (The goal isn’t to create an L-shape with your right leg; your foot can be tucked as close to your hips as needed.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Extend your left leg long behind you and rest the top of your foot on the mat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep your right foot flexed and try to keep your pelvis neutral and your left hip as close to the mat as you can. If your hip lifts off the floor, bring your right foot a little closer to your body.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should feel a stretch in your right hip. Hold for 30 to 60 seconds. Switch sides and repeat.
    </p>
    <h5>
        To make sure your pelvis stays neutral, place a block or pillow underneath your externally rotated hip. You can also place a pillow or block underneath the knee on your straight leg to alleviate any pain. For a deeper stretch, lean your torso forward and rest your forehead on the ground, arms framing your face or resting at your sides.
